# Chess Game

## Project Description

This is a simple chess game we're building as a group project. Itâ€™s going to include all the basic rules of chess, and possibly even an AI you can play against if we have time. The idea is to make it playable through a simple interface, either in the terminal or with a basic GUI depending on what we decide as a team.
